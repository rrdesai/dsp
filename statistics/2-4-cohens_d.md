[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> The Cohen's D statistic for first babies birth weight vs other babies birth weight is -0.08 which indicates that first babies are slightly lighter than other babies on average. This is backed up by the fact that the difference in means is -0.12 pounds. 

>> The Cohen's D statistic for pregnancy length when comparing first babies to others is 0.029 which indicates that first pregnancies last marginally longer than others on average. This is confirmed by the mean difference which is 0.07 weeks longer for first babies.
